App.py under News-Map\webpage\server\bridge\app.py is the running point for FLASK.
remember to have webpack and parcel setup with proper paths -- define:

    PATH_TO_CLIENT_ROOT =
    PATH_TO_STATIC_ROOT =
    PATH_TO_PUBLIC_ROOT =
    PATH_TO_SCRIPTS_ROOT =
    PATH_TO_DATA_ROOT =

under .env file. The client root should come to the folder leading to index.html and static should likewise lead to the
file containing the file webpack bundled. (in my case it is \News-Map\webpage\client and \News-Map\public respectively)

After those envs have been set, run in console under the \News-Map\webpage directory the command "npm run prod" and
witness magic. bundle.js should have all files properly bundled, allowing for flask to serve index.html and all public
files properly. The site should load up a map and work from there
